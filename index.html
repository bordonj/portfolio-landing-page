          <div class="header">Why Programming?</div>
          <p class="background">After getting my doctorates after a total of 8 years in graduate school, I knew I wanted to expand my set of skills. My research interests included studying the experiences of those <strong>underrepresented in STEM fields.</strong> I always admired those who were able to take on the challenge of being in a place that they may not felt they belonged in, especially how they navigated barriers and persevered. As I'm entering my life into a career, I think that being able to be in the tech industry would achieve one of my goals I've always had. I think the underrepresentation of certain groups of people limits the advances and creativity the tech field could have, and hopefully I could add to it with my own unique experiences.</p>
          <div class="header">Miscellaneous</div>
          <p class="background"><img src="img/hamster.jpeg" id="hamster">Some of my current interests include trying to gain more understanding of full-stack development. I'm interested in broadening my knowledge to learn of the powerful tools a developer has in creating their space in the web. My first pet I ever had was a hamster, and its name was <b>Zsa Zsa</b>. It was so cute, but its lifespan was only about 2 years. Afterwards, I never had a pet because of the heartbreak of losing one :(. I also enjoy <em>food</em>. Food is a necessity, and when I say food, I mean all kinds of food. I especially love spicy food! In terms of what I do to pass time, I like to browse youtube for cute animals. Please check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqTDWgTQUgYwqy6MDArHn0A" target="_blank">Cat Spa</a> for a way to fall asleep and relax.</p>
