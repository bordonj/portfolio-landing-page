          <div class="header">Why Programming?</div>
          <p class="background">After getting my doctorates after a total of 8 years in graduate school, I knew I wanted to expand my set of skills. My research interests included studying the experiences of those underrepresented in STEM fields. I always admired those who were able to take on the challenge of being in a place that they may not felt they belonged in, especially how they navigated barriers and persevered. As I'm entering my life into a career, I think that being able to be in the tech industry would achieve one of my goals I've always had. I think the underrepresentation of certain groups of people limits the advances and creativity the tech field could have, and hopefully I could add to it with my own unique experiences.</p>
