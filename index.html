          <div class="header">Why Programming?</div>
          <p class="background">After getting my doctorates after a total of 8 years in graduate school, I knew I wanted to expand my set of skills. In middle school, I would design layouts for websites for free website platforms, such as <i><b>geocities, angelfire, xanga, and myspace.</b></i> Unfortunately, these were all deleted, and I lost my portfolio of work, in addition to my passion to continue coding back then. Now that I'm older, and heard of a possibility to regain the skills I once had (and learn a breadth and depth of much more!), I decided to take the opportunity.

          In terms of my academic career, my research interests included studying the experiences of those <strong>underrepresented in STEM fields.</strong> I always admired those who were able to take on the challenge of being in a place that they may not felt they belonged in, especially how they navigated barriers and persevered. As I'm entering my life into a career, I think that being able to be in the tech industry would achieve one of my goals I've always had. The underrepresentation of certain groups of people in the tech industry limits the advances and creativity the tech field could have, and hopefully I could add to it with my own unique experiences.</p>

          <p class="background"><img src="img/hamster.jpeg" id="hamster">Some of my current interests include trying to gain more understanding of full-stack development. I'm interested in broadening my knowledge to learn of the powerful tools a developer has in creating their space in the web. My first pet I ever had was a hamster, and its name was <b>Zsa Zsa</b>. It was so cute, but its lifespan was only about 2 years. Afterwards, I never had a pet because of the heartbreak of losing one :(. I also enjoy <em>food</em>. Food is a necessity, and when I say food, I mean all kinds of food. I especially love spicy food! In terms of what I do to pass time, I like to browse youtube for cute animals.
